            `Here's what to expect during your professional whitening session.
            <b>Preparation:</b> Before the whitening procedure, the dental professional will
            assess your oral health and may perform a professional cleaning to remove any surface stains and plaque.

            <b>Isolation:</b> To protect the gums and surrounding tissues, a protective
            barrier will be applied to isolate the teeth that will undergo the whitening treatment.

            <b>Application of Whitening Gel:</b> A high concentration hydrogen peroxide-based whitening gel is applied to the teeth.

            <b>Activation with LED Light:</b> The Zoom WhiteSpeed lamp will be directed
            on the teeth to activate the whitening gel. The light helps accelerate the
            breakdown of the peroxide gel, promoting the release of oxygen molecules that penetrate the enamel to break down stains in the dentin

            <b>Multiple Sessions:</b> The whitening process typically involves three
            sessions, each lasting around 15 minutes.`

            `Despite its effectiveness and safety under professional supervision, it's important to note that the procedure has its limitations. The degree of whitening achieved varies among individuals, and results may not be as dramatic for certain types of stains or discoloured teeth.
            
            Additionally, some patients may experience tooth sensitivity during or after the whitening procedure. This sensitivity is usually temporary and can be managed with desensitizing agents provided by the clinic. It's essential for individuals considering this cosmetic procedure to have realistic expectations and to consult with their dentist with any questions.`
