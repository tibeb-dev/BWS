                            <li><b>Numbing:</b> To ensure a painless experience, numbing the tooth is common. Our skilled staff will make every effort to keep you comfortable throughout the freezing part of the procedure.</li>

                            <li><b>Sensitivity:</b> It's normal to experience sensitivity that may start after the
                                procedure. This sensitivity typically goes away after 4 weeks. The sensitivity may
                                last up to 90 days. This may result from drilling, the materials used, heat from
                                the light, or interactions with gum and other tissues.

                            Sometimes cavities are very deep that enter the nerve tissue of the tooth. A
                            nerve may get infected or irritated from repeated trauma or offences to the tooth.
                            In order to preserve the tooth and remove the nerve issue, a root canal therapy is
                            necessary where all the nerve contents of the tooth are removed and the tooth is
                            disinfected and filled. A permanent long term restoration will be necessary in
                            order to restore the integrity and structural strength of the tooth.
                            This procedure may take one or two sessions. The tooth needs to be isolated
                            well, then the canals needs to be found and disinfected, then the canals needs to
                            be filled and sealed by a specific material. Expect your mouth to be open and
                            your teeth isolated with a rubber dam on for the entire period of the appointment,
                            appointments may run longer, and a flare up after the appointment is common.
                            The dentist will provide a prescription if necessary. Wear comfortable clothes and
                            ask our team how we can make this procedure more pleasant for you.
