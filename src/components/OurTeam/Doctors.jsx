After obtaining his dental license in Canada, he travelled north to serve the rural communities of the Yukon practicing patient-centric dentistry.

Dhia strives to provide painless dentistry and aims to deliver all treatments in a low-stress and anxiety-free environment. Dhia is trained in minimal sedation techniques which he can offer to his apprehensive patients. He is excited to be back home with his wife living in the beautiful Kitsilano neighborhood, exploring the beautiful bike trails of the west coast, and playing tennis and soccer by the beach.'

        bio: 'Dr. Asif Tejani completed his dental degree and post-graduate AEGD [Advanced Education in General Dentistry] program at the University of Pennsylvania.  He relocated to Vancouver to complete his GPR [General Practice Residency] program at UBC.  However, one year was just not enough to hike all the mountains, kayak all the fjords, bike all the trails and swim in all the water bodies of this beautiful province.  He has thus resigned himself to live here as long as BC will have him.  Asif served as Clinic Coordinator of the VGH, Department of Dentistry for 15 years and is currently a consultant and clinician at Oral Oncology, BC Cancer Hospital.  He is passionate about a holistic approach to dental care and likes to believe that he works hard and plays hard too.'

She strives to provide gentle, efficient, and effective treatment while developing fun and interactive environment for her patients. When Jen is not in the office, she is usually planning her next trip to other countries all over the world. Since 2015, she has traveled from Europe to Asia and everything in between and lived in Australia for 2 years. She is happy to call Vancouver home and is continuing to explore everything our beautiful city has to offer.'
